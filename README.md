This Sales Performance Dashboard offers a visually engaging overview of essential business metrics, aiding data-driven decision-making. It shows total transactions, including the quantity of goods sold, total cost, revenue, and overall profit or loss, providing a snapshot of business health. The categorical visualisations include a line chart tracking profit trends monthly and annually, while the bar chart displays the top ten states by profit, highlighting regional strengths. Demographic insights are shown through a doughnut chart of profit by gender and a bar chart illustrating contributions by customer age groups. Product performance is analysed with a clustered bar chart across categories. Users can filter data by salesperson, age group, and payment option for tailored, actionable insights.
